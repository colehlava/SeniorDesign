## Overview
We are a group in UCSC's CSE123 Senior Design class. This repository stores all of our code, as well as give an insight on our project and our research that went into it. As of right now our design project is building a robotic arm which can remotely provide live video feed, live Geiger Counter, humidity sensor, and temperature readings. We are using 2 Raspberry Pi's for transmitting and receiving data, and a Cypress PSoC 5 to read all of the data. There is a great risk associated with inspections at nuclear plants and sites, our goal is to reduce the danger of said inspections by allowing vision and radiation readings remotely.
